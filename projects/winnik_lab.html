                At Winnik Lab, I worked on analyzing paint samples provided by the chemical company BASF. One of my tasks was to measure evaporation rate over time of paint samples. I prepared paint samples on cover slides and weighted them every hour as shown on the image to the right. A greater decay of rate of evaporation over time indicates stratification (separation into two components) since it implies that water is trapped underneath the top layer of film.

            <p>
                I also ran UV-vis spectroscopy samples to determine dye content of the paint samples. Phen and Nben dyes were attached to the ARO and latex respectively, so dye content is critical for FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) analysis later. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I helped with the FRET tests using a time-correlated single-photon counting device that can measure the fluorescence lifetime of a sample as shown on the image to the left. Using this technique, we can determine the efficiency of energy transfer between the dyes. A low efficiency would indicate that the dyes are not close enough to transfer energy, which would be a sign of stratification.
