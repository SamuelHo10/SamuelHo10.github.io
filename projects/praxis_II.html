                For Praxis II, my group was assigned to the community: Allan Gardens. We were tasked with the objective of minimizing the effort required for vermicomposting (composting with worms). Our final design was a massive wheel which could rotate to sift out the soil and keep the worms in. One of the key design features is a lid to hold worms inside, so they do not need to be transferred to another container.

                We definitely spent too much time on this project. Our grouped skipped nearly all our classes in the last two weeks to work on the final presentation and prototype. Furthermore, we spent nearly 300 dollars worth of our own money on building materials. However, in the end, the teaching assistants responsible for grading us did not like our presentation during showcase and gave us a 75% &#128557;.
