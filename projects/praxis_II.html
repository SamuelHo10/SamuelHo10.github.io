                For Praxis II, our group was assigned to the community of Allan Gardens. We were tasked with designing something to minimize the effort required for vermicomposting (composting with worms). Our final design was a massive worm wheel which could rotate to sift out the soil and keep the worms in. We also included a lid to hold worms inside, so they do not need to be transferred.

                We spent way too much time on this project. Our team skipped most of the last two weeks of classes to work on the final presentation and prototype. Furthermore, we spent nearly 300 dollars worth of our own money on building materials. However, for some reason the teaching assistants did not like our presentation during showcase and gave us a 75%. I was very upset.
