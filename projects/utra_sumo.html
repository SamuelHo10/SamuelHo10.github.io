                For the 2023-2024 academic year, I joined the University of Toronto Robotics Association (UTRA) and participated in the SUMO Bot competition. The goal of the competition was to design and build a robot that could push the opponent robot out of the ring. The robot had to be autonomous and could not be controlled by a human operator. It also had to be under a certain size and weight limit.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was our first time working with CAD software and SolidWorks, so my group tried optimizing a pretty simple design using an ultrasonic sensor and a motor they provided us with. However, tragedy struck right before the competition: a copper pin broke off the motor, and we weren't able to solder it back on. We ended up going to a nearby store to buy a new motor, but although it looked identical, a few of the dimensions were slightly off by half a millimeter. This caused our wheels to come loose during the competition.
