                My first significant electronics project in high school was building an 8x8x8 LED cube. The cube was controlled by an Arduino Uno and utilized a 3-to-8 line decoder multiplexer along with eight D-type octal flip-flops to manage the LED connections efficiently.

With limited electronics experience at the time, I followed an online circuit diagram. After successfully testing the circuit on a breadboard, I transferred the design to EasyEDA, a circuit design tool, and ordered custom PCBs.

This was also my first experience with soldering. Initially, my connections were not clean, and I burned my hand several times in the process (Ouch!), but but as I continued assembling the layers of the cube, my soldering skills improved. Additionally, to save costs, I opted for copper wires instead of steel, which led to alignment issues due to copper's softness and flexibility, affecting the cube's structure.

Another issue occurred when I accidentally ordered an inverted 3-to-8 line decoder multiplexer. Thankfully, I was able to resolve it by inverting the enable pin connections of the decoder.

Despite facing several obstacles such as faulty connections, broken LEDs, and minor alignment issues, I was able to complete the project. The LED cube functions well, although there's a small ghosting effect that I plan to address in the future.
