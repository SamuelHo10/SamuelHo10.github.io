                My first "major" electronics project in high school is the 8x8x8 LED cube. The cube
                is controlled by an Arduino Uno and uses a 3 to 8 line decoder multiplexer in combination with 8 D-type
                octal flip-flops to provide enough connections for all the LEDs. At this point, I had minimal
                experience with electronics, so I thought it would be best for me to follow a circuit diagram I found
                online. After testing everything on a breadboard, I copied the circuit onto easyEDA and ordered the PCBs
                online. Luckily this went pretty smoothly considering it was my
                first time ordering PCBs online.

                This was also my first time soldering. The connections I made were not very clean early on, and I burnt
                myself
                several dozen times in the process. Ouch! Additionally, instead of using steel wires, I bought copper
                wires to try to cut down costs. This turned out to be a terrible decision since copper is a lot more
                soft and ductile compared with steel. As a result, the wires would often misalign themselves while I was
                soldering causing the cube to be crooked.

                Another issue arose when I found out I ordered an inverted 3 to 8 line decoder multiplexer instead of
                the non-inverted one. Luckily this was an easy fix since I just had to change a couple of pin
                connections
                and adjust the code on the Arduino. There were many other problems along the way as well such as faulty
                connections, broken LEDs, and LEDs turning on when they should not be. However, I am still glad in the
                end that the cube looks epic and is mostly working (there is still this ghosting effect which I have not yet fixed).
